# Course Selling App - Express Server Project

Welcome to my Course Selling App Express Server project repository! In this project, I've developed a backend server using Express.js to support a Course Selling platform. The app allows both administrators and users to interact with the platform, with role-based functionality and JWT-based authentication.


## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)


## Features

### Admin Features

- Admin authentication: Sign in and sign up functionality with JWT-based authentication.
- Course management: Create, publish, unpublish, view, edit, and delete courses.
- Secure endpoints: Authentication middleware ensures only authorized admin users can access admin functionalities.

### User Features

- User authentication: Sign in and sign up with JWT-based authentication.
- Course purchasing: Users can purchase courses available on the platform.
- Course browsing: Users can view and explore available courses.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in:

- Building RESTful APIs using Express.js for different user roles.
- Implementing role-based authentication and authorization using JWT tokens.
- Interacting with MongoDB to store and manage user, admin, and course data.
